# Algebraic Types

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type): In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.

Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions, coproduct types or variant types
